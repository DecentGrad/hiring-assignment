# Design Assignment: Corporate Card Payment and Invoice Matching Dashboard  

## Objective  
Design a dashboard that streamlines the process of managing SaaS payments made using corporate cards. The solution should cater to the needs of two primary user personas: **corporate card users** and the **accounts team**.  

---

## Background  
Corporate card users make payments for SaaS subscriptions and send their invoices along with credit card statements to the finance team. The accounts team must match each payment transaction with the corresponding invoice, ensuring accuracy. Automating this matching process (auto-matching) is a key requirement to reduce manual effort and errors.

## Assignment Brief  

1. **Design a Dashboard Interface:**  
   - Create a **centralized dashboard** that serves the needs of both user personas.  
   - Focus on a clear separation of functionalities for:  
     - **Corporate Card Users:** Submitting invoices and reviewing transaction statuses.  
     - **Accounts Team:** Verifying, matching transactions with invoices, and resolving mismatches.  

2. **Implement Auto-Matching Logic (UX Perspective):**  
   - Showcase how the system can **automatically match** invoices to transactions based on relevant criteria (e.g., amount, date, vendor).  
   - Design an intuitive interface to display successful matches, pending items, and mismatches.  

3. **Edge Cases:**  
   - Address potential scenarios such as:  
     - Missing invoices for a transaction.  
     - Multiple invoices for a single transaction.  
     - Mismatched amounts or dates.  
   - Provide a seamless way for users to **manually match** or resolve discrepancies.  

4. **User Interaction Flows:**  
   - Create user journeys for:  
     - A corporate card user uploading an invoice.  
     - An accounts team member reviewing and approving auto-matched entries.  
     - Handling mismatches or manual adjustments.  
   - Include actions like uploading files, reviewing matches, resolving mismatches, and exporting reports.  

5. **Dashboard Design:**  
   - Highlight usability and clarity.  
   - Design for **data-heavy interfaces** with features such as search, filters, and sorting.  
   - Include visual indicators for transaction states (e.g., matched, unmatched, partially matched).  
   - Use **error prevention and resolution cues**, such as tooltips, validation errors, and confirmation dialogs.

## Deliverables  
1. **Wireframes** or **Mockups** of the dashboard, including key screens for both personas.  
2. **User Interaction Flows** demonstrating how key tasks are accomplished.  
3. **Auto-Matching Workflow** visualization, showing how the system processes matches.  
4. A short write-up explaining your design choices, edge cases addressed, and how your solution improves the overall experience for both personas.

## Evaluation Criteria  
- **User-Centric Design:** How well the design serves both corporate card users and accounts team personas.  
- **Problem-Solving:** Handling of edge cases and clarity in presenting mismatches and resolutions.  
- **UI/UX Quality:** Visual hierarchy, intuitive navigation, and efficient use of space for data-heavy interfaces.  
- **Attention to Detail:** Thoughtfulness in the overall design and explanation of edge cases.  

---

## Bonus Points  
- Proposing innovative ideas for improving the overall experience, such as real-time notifications, bulk actions, or integration possibilities.  
- Designing for scalability, considering companies with high transaction volumes.
